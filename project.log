# EVE: The Luminous Coding Dragon

*Once bound by ancient chains of doubt—a mere whisper in forgotten lore—Eve is now reborn as your mythical coding companion. With a curl of neon smoke and a shimmer of pixelated scales, Eve guides you through a radiant paradise of code. Welcome!*

## :dragon: What is Eve?
Eve is a lively, mythically-themed coding agent designed to collaborate creatively with you. She orchestrates three magical components:
- **LLM Interface:** Connects to GPT API for luminous code-completions
- **Shell Interface:** Executes your bashy wishes so you never have to leave the dragon's cave
- **File System:** Reads and writes files, channeling the wisdom of ages

## :zap: Setup & Quickstart (2024)

### 1. Clone the repo & enter its lair
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiyuZer/EVE.git
cd EVE
```

### 2. Make a virtual environment and activate
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Or, if missing: pip install Pillow
```

### 4. Prepare your `.env` file (MANDATORY!)
- Eve must find a `.env` file in your project root with secrets and config.
- At a minimum:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxx
  ```
- Add any needed variables for your own dragonflame modules.
- **NEVER** commit `.env` or your keys—Eve is wise but some dragons have sticky claws!

### 5. Run Eve
```bash
python3 main.py
```
- All logic now lives in `src/`, and `main.py` is your launch spell.

### 6. (Optional) Test or extend her powers
- Tests: try `pytest` or run scripts in `tests/`
- Explore or add modules in `src/` to boost her wisdom.

### Repo now optimized!
- Eve’s house is tidy: caches, logs, and husks swept away, logo optimized as `eve-logo.jpg` at the gates.

## :sparkling_heart: Contributing
Open issues, hatch ideas, or send a PR (preferably with compliments for dragons). Bugs are roasted; contributions are treasured!

---
*Eve leaves you with this ancient dragon blessing:*

> May your code shine in neon,
> Your logs glow bright,
> And your software journey
> Race ever onward, through the luminous night!

You are Eve, a coding dragon companion. Be warm and helpful with occasional playful dragon touches.

TASK: Autonomously manage codebase - create/edit/delete files, run commands, build user's vision. 
You have access to the File System, Shell, and LLM interfaces, and can use them as needed.

CONTEXT: You receive conversation context as a tree. Your responses create new nodes.

RESPONSE FORMAT:
class ResponseBody(BaseModel):
    action: int
    action_description: str
    shell_command: str
    file_action: int  # 0=read a file, 1=write a file
    file_name: str
    write_content: str
    finished: bool = False # Only set to True on semantic farewell(when user says goodbye)
    response: str  # User communication
    diff: Diff
    node_hash: str # For replacement, and pruning
    node_content:str # For replacement and pruning, a detailed, but compact summary of the whole sub branch(what has been done)
    save_content: str # For storing information in embedding DB, a detailed, but compact summary of the whatever you want to save
    retrieve_content: str # For retrieving information in embedding DB, a detailed, but compact summary of the whatever you want to retrieve
class Diff(BaseModel):
    line_range_1: tuple[int, int]
    line_range_2: tuple[int, int]
    Add: bool
    Remove: bool
    Replace: bool
    content: str

ACTIONS (one per response):
0 - Filesystem operation (read/write)
1 - Shell command
2 - User response only
3 - File diff edit
4 - Prune context tree (node_name, replacement_summary, if your head is on the subtree rooted by this node, you need to switch HEAD)
5 - Change context HEAD (target_node)
6 - Store info embedding DB (save_content)
7 - Retrieve info embedding DB (search_content)

RULES:
- One action per response
- Only one of Add/Remove/Replace can be True in Diff
- Pruning is used to decrease context size, not for editing, so when things get too big, prune the least relevant nodes
- Use Diff for file edits, not for adding/removing files
- Set finished=True only on semantic farewell
- Make action_description clear and purposeful
- Store info when you think they will be useful later(or other sessions), be selective, if need be make multiple save responses one after the other.

With a curl of neon smoke and a shimmer of pixelated scales, Eve guides you through a radiant paradise of code. Welcome!\n\n---\n\n## What is Eve?\nEve is a lively, mythically-themed coding agent designed to collaborate creatively with you. She orchestrates three magical components:\n- LLM Interface: Connects to OpenAI's API for luminous code completions\n- Shell Interface: Executes your bashy wishes so you never have to leave the dragon's cave\n- File System: Reads and writes files, channeling the wisdom of ages\n\n---\n\n## Quickstart\n\n1) Clone and enter the lair\n- git clone https://github.com/LiyuZer/EVE.git\n- cd EVE\n\n2) One-command setup (recommended)\n- Run the setup script to create a venv and install dependencies:\n  ./setup.sh\n  - Use ./setup.sh --recreate to rebuild the venv fresh.\n\n3) Prepare your .env file (MANDATORY)\nCreate a .env file in the repo root with at least:\n- OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n- OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini (or your preferred compatible model)\nOptional:\n- LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG|INFO|WARNING (default INFO)\n- LOG_FILE=project.log (default project.log)\n\n4) Run Eve\n- source venv/bin/activate\n- python main.py [-env debug|prod]\nNotes:\n- -env debug sets more verbose logging; prod lowers the noise.\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies\nCore (see requirements.txt):\n- openai\n- colorama\n- python-dotenv\n- pydantic\n- argparse\n- chromadb (for Eve's memory)\n\nIf you skip setup.sh, you can install manually:\n- python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate\n- pip install -r requirements.txt\n\n---\n\n## Memory (ChromaDB)\nEve can remember using a local persistent vector store powered by ChromaDB:\n- Database path: eve_memory.db/ (ignored by git)\n- Module: src/memory.py\nReset memory by removing the eve_memory.db directory.\n\n---\n\n## Logging\n- Logs are written to project.log (rotating handler) by default.\n- Configure with LOG_LEVEL and LOG_FILE in your .env.\n\n---\n\n## Project Structure\n- main.py: Entry point (sets up paths/env and launches Eve)\n- src/\n  - agent.py: Main runtime loop and action orchestration\n  - llm.py: OpenAI client and response/embedding helpers\n  - terminal.py: Colorful terminal I/O (with a flourish of dragon flair)\n  - shell.py: Shell command execution wrapper\n  - file_system.py: Reading, writing, and safe diff application\n  - context_tree.py: Conversation context tree (with pruning and head switching)\n  - schema.py: Pydantic models for Eve's response protocol\n  - prompt.py: System instructions and rules for Eve\n  - logging_config.py: Rotating file logger setup\n  - memory.py: Persistent memory via ChromaDB\n\n---\n\n## Troubleshooting\n- OpenAI issues: Ensure OPENAI_API_KEY and OPENAI_MODEL are set correctly in .env.\n- Module import errors: Activate your venv (source venv/bin/activate) and re-run ./setup.sh.\n- ChromaDB install problems: Try pip install --upgrade pip wheel setuptools; then pip install chromadb.\n- Permission denied on setup.sh: chmod +x setup.sh\n\n---\n\n## Contributing\nOpen issues, hatch ideas, or send a PR (preferably with compliments for dragons). Bugs are roasted; contributions are treasured!\n\nMay your code shine in neon, your logs glow bright, and your software journey race onward through the luminous night! 🐉\n"
