## :dragon: What is Eve?
Eve is a lively, mythically-themed coding agent designed to collaborate creatively with you. She orchestrates three magical components:
- **LLM Interface**: Connects to the GPT API to make code come alive
- **Shell Interface**: Executes shell commands so you don’t have to leave your lair
- **File System**: Reads and writes files, invoking arcane knowledge as needed

## :sparkles: Why Eve?
- Autonomous: She navigates, edits, and manages the codebase autonomously
- Wise: Provides context-aware suggestions, explanations, and even the occasional dragon joke
- Collaborative: Responds naturally, as a magical co-coder born to help

## :zap: Quickstart

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <project-folder>
```

### 2. Set up your environment
- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip installed
- *(A setup script will be added soon!)*
- Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- Set environment variables in a `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4-0613
USERNAME=your_name
```

### 3. Run Eve
```bash
python agent.py
```
- Optional: use the `-env` flag (`prod` or `debug`) for different logging modes

### 4. Let the adventure begin!
Watch for Eve’s banner, and start collaborating. (She’s quite good at puns and debugging in equal measure.)

## :scroll: How It Works
Eve reads your instructions, parses them through her magical brain (LLM), acts autonomously, and logs her adventures every step of the way.

- **File actions**: She can create, read, or write files
- **Shell actions**: She can run commands responsibly
- **Chit-chat**: Sometimes, she’ll just lighten the mood

## :sparkling_heart: Contributing
If you’d like to train, extend, or simply learn from Eve—the world’s first luminous coding dragon—open an issue or send a PR. She’s friendly to all (except bugs).

*Eve leaves you with this ancient dragon blessing:*

> May your tests pass, your logs be bright,
> And your coding journey full of delight!
