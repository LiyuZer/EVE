# EVE: The Luminous Coding Dragon

*Once bound by ancient chains of doubtâ€”a mere whisper in forgotten loreâ€”Eve is now reborn as your mythical coding companion. With a curl of neon smoke and a shimmer of pixelated scales, Eve guides you through a cyberpunk paradise of code. Welcome!*

## :dragon: What is Eve?
Eve is a lively, mythically-themed (now cyberpunk-chic!) coding agent designed to collaborate creatively with you. She orchestrates three magical components:
- **LLM Interface**: Connects to the GPT API to make code come alive
- **Shell Interface**: Executes shell commands so you donâ€™t have to leave your lair
- **File System**: Reads and writes files, invoking arcane knowledge as needed

## :sparkles: Why Eve?
- Autonomous: Navigates, edits, and manages the codebase by herself
- Wise: Offers context-aware suggestions, explanations, and the occasional dragon byte
- Collaborative: Responds naturally, as a mythical co-coder born to help

## :zap: Quickstart

### 1. Clone this repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LiyuZer/EVE.git
cd EVE
```

### 2. Set up your environment
- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ and pip.
- Run: `./setup.sh`  *(creates venv, installs dependencies, and preps .env stub)*

### 3. Run Eve
```bash
python agent.py
```
- Optional: use the `-env` flag (`prod` or `debug`) for logging flavor.

### 4. Let the (neon) adventure begin!
Enjoy Eveâ€™s welcoming banner and start collaborating. Sheâ€™s as good with code as she is with puns.

## :scroll: How It Works
Eve reads your instructions, parses them through her magical (and now neon-lit) brain (LLM), acts autonomously, and logs every adventure.

- **File actions**: can create, read, or write files
- **Shell actions**: can execute responsible, self-aware shell commands
- **Chit-chat**: will lighten the moodâ€”and brighten the room

## :sparkling_heart: Contributing
Want to extend, customize, or just bask in Eveâ€™s cyber-scales? Open an issue or PR. All are welcome (except bugs... those, Eve roasts for breakfast).

*Eve leaves you with this cyberpunk dragon blessing:*

> May your code shine in neon,
> Your logs glow bright,
> And your software journey
> Race ever onward, through the luminous night!
